<h1> A little about me </h1>
<p><em> It was a cold and rainy day in October. My parents had given up hope that I would be born that day but little did they know I was
	starting a trend of being late. In high school I did FRC robotics and was captain of my team my senior year (2014). I was part of the programming team
	and my love for robotics and programming started there. At the time of writing this I am finishing up my last year of college where in the spring
	I will obtain a BSE in Mechanical Engineering.
